      <h1>UN sustainability goals</h1>
      <h2>Goal 2: End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved
        Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture. <br> Our project 
        contributes to Goal 2 by aiming to fulfill two sub targets:</h2>
      <h3>Protecting Small Farmers:</h3>
      <p>
        By prioritizing the support and growth of small-scale farmers 
        we intend to enhance local food production and food security.

      </p>
      <h3>Preserving Genetic Diversity in Crops</h3>
      <p>
        We are committed to preserving and promoting genetic diversity in 
        crops to ensure long-term agricultural sustainability.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal 11: Make Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable: </h2>
      <p>
        Our application focuses on creating an inclusive platform that connects urban and rural communities while promoting sustainable food practices. <br>
        Furthermore, our application promotes safe and resilient food supply chains within cities and settlements. <br>
        The exact sub target that we intend to fulfill in this goal is:
      </p>
      <h3>
        Keep city air clean:
      </h3>
      <p>
        By avoiding transportation of produce that is also grown in our local area, e.g. the cheapest grapes in supermarkets are often imported from the south of europe, <br>
        however, local farmers can sell their locally grown grapes from home they are able to compete with the price in supermarkets. <br>
        Furthermore, it is much more beneficial for the environment if the produce is locally grown and unnecessary transportation is avoided. 

      </p>
      <h2>Goal 12: Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns:
      </h2>
      <p>
        We contribute to Goal 12 by encouraging users of our platform to make informed choices regarding the consumption of locally sourced and sustainable food products. <br>
        By supporting sustainable farming and hunting practices, we aim to ensure the responsible production of food. <br>
        The subtarget we intend to fulfill is the following:
      </p>
      <h3>
        Halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer level: 
      </h3>
      <p>
        By being able to sell your locally grown produce (or hunted meat) that you are not able to consume you reduce unnecessary waste.

  </p>
  <h2>Browse local sellers: </h2>
    <p>
      The different local sellers are all located on a map on the front page. By clicking on a pin you will see additional information about that perticular seller. <br>
      A selection of ads containing information about location, product sold and price, will also be displayed in the column on the lefthand side of the page. <br>
      The searchbar above the selection of ads can be used to search for ???. Next to the search bar there is also a filter button that can be used to <br> 
      display only a certain category and/or item. In order to filter on a certain item a category needs to be chosen first, e.g. to display only the ads containing the <br>
      item 'Bananas' you will first have to choose the category 'Fruits' thereafter you can choose the item 'Bananas'. <br>
      You can also choose to filter only on a category, e.g. by choosing the category 'Fruits' and then pressing the filter button. <br>
